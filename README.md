## What's This All About?

Living in Bhilai and tired of waiting at bus stops without knowing when the next bus will arrive? Or maybe you're a student at BIT College trying to figure out the cheapest way to get home? This app has got your back!

I built this because navigating public transport in our region can be a real pain. Whether you're commuting to the Steel Plant, heading to Maitri Bagh for a weekend outing, or catching a train from Durg station, this app makes it super easy.

## What Can You Do With It?

### 🚌 **Track Buses in Real-Time**
- See exactly when the next bus will arrive at your stop
- Find routes from Civic Center to anywhere you want to go
- Get live updates for all major routes (Bhilai ↔ Durg ↔ Raipur)
- Calculate fares so you know exactly how much to carry

### 🆘 **Stay Safe with Emergency Features**
- One-tap SOS button that shares your location with emergency services
- Quick dial for Police (100), Ambulance (108), Fire (101), and Women's Helpline (1091)
- Find the nearest hospitals with directions and contact numbers
- Perfect for late-night travel or when you're in an unfamiliar area

### 🎓 **Student-Friendly Features**
- Special routes to colleges like BIT, DPS, and St. Thomas
- Student discount information
- Cheapest route options (because we know money's tight!)

### 🌱 **Go Green**

## How to Use It

No downloads, no setup - works instantly on any device!

4. Start exploring!

## For the Tech-Savvy Folks

This is built as a web application that works on any device - your phone, laptop, or tablet. Here's what's under the hood:

- **Frontend**: Pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no fancy frameworks needed!)
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express (for the full-featured version)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (stores all route and schedule data)
- **Maps**: Integrated with location services for real-time tracking

### Want to Run the Full Version?

If you want to set up the complete system with backend services:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up the backend
cd backend
npm install

# Start the backend server
npm start

# In another terminal, start the frontend
npm run start
```

## What Makes This Special?

Unlike generic transport apps, this one is built specifically for our region. I've included:

- **Local Knowledge**: Routes that actually matter to people living here
- **Real Places**: Civic Center, Maitri Bagh, Steel Plant, BIT College - places you actually go to
- **Local Numbers**: Emergency contacts that work in Chhattisgarh
- **Student Focus**: Because a huge part of our population are students who need affordable transport

## A Personal Note

I created this app because I believe technology should solve real problems for real people. Public transport in smaller cities like ours often gets overlooked by big tech companies. This is my small attempt to make daily commuting a bit easier for everyone in our community.

Whether you're a daily commuter, a college student, or someone who occasionally needs to get around town, I hope this app makes your journey a little smoother.
